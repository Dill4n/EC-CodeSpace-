/* comments:

- function named 'randNum' for remembrance

- * 10 was used for easier & quicker testing

- Math.ceil was used over Math.floor for shorter code, and to remove potential decimals.

- input + '? ' + 'Sorry, nope! Guess again..'  was configured to mention your answer + loss

- if () prints "You won!" on physical document + console.
