// HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are used to modify or customise the behaviour of those elements. 
// They are always included in the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. 
// The value is enclosed in double or single quotes.

// Here's a simple example:

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>

// In this anchor (<a>) element, the href and target attributes are used. 
// The href attribute specifies the URL that the link points to, and the target attribute determines how the linked resource will be displayed (in this case, it opens in a new browser window or tab).

/* Some common HTML attributes include:

id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
class: Assigns one or more class names to an element, allowing CSS styles to be applied.
src: Specifies the source URL of embedded content, such as images or scripts.
alt: Provides alternative text for images, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.
style: Defines inline CSS styles for an element.
width and height: Set the width and height of elements like images and tables.
disabled: Disables user interaction with an input element or button.
placeholder: Displays a short hint in an input field before a user enters a value.
value: Sets the initial value for form elements like input fields.
HTML attributes vary depending on the type of element they are applied to, and different elements may support different attributes.
